# Employee-Database
A content management system for tracking and adding employees, roles, and departments.

## User Story
As a business owner, I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company so that I can organize and plan my business.

## Installation

`npm install`

Run 'schema.sql' in MySQL.

Make sure the connection properties in 'app.js' match the database and localhost of the MySQL database.

## Use
Run `node app.js` in the terminal.

Click through any of the database options (such as View Employee) to view the corresponding table, or click on one of the 'Add' options to add to a specific database.
